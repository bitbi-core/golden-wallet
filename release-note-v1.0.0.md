# Golden Wallet v1.0.0 Release Notes

## Major Release Highlights

We're excited to announce the release of Golden Wallet v1.0.0, marking a significant milestone in our commitment to providing a secure and user-friendly cryptocurrency wallet solution.

### üîê Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallet Implementation
- Introduced HD wallet functionality allowing all wallet addresses and keys to be derived from a single seed phrase
- Simplified backup and recovery process - users only need to securely store one seed phrase
- Enhanced wallet recovery capabilities across different devices

### üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Security Features

#### New Unlock Password System
- Added mandatory unlock password protection for wallet access
- Implemented password hardening using Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF) technology
- Protects wallet access even if an attacker gains physical access to your computer

#### Advanced Password Hardening
- Integrated OPRF-based password hardening system
- Enhances password security without exposing sensitive data
- Requires network access for password hardening, but maintains complete client-side security
- No sensitive information is ever transmitted to backend servers

### üîÑ Recovery Options
- Primary recovery through seed phrase backup
- Ability to recover full wallet access if unlock password is lost
- All assets can be restored using only the seed phrase

## Security Notes

- The wallet requires internet access for the OPRF password hardening process
- All cryptographic operations are performed client-side
- No sensitive data (passwords, private keys, or seed phrases) is ever transmitted to servers
- For technical details about the OPRF implementation, you can refer to:
  - [OPRF Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblivious_pseudorandom_function#Password-based_key_derivation)
  - Golden Wallet's open-source code

## Migration from v0.x.x

Users upgrading from previous versions will need to:
1. Back up their existing wallet data
2. Create a new HD wallet in v1.0.0
3. Transfer their assets to the new wallet:
   - For BTB assets: Transfer to your new wallet addresses
   - **For ETH/WBTB assets**: 
     - Important: Your ETH address in v1.0.0 will be different from your v0.x.x address
     - To transfer ETH from your old wallet:
       1. Go to the Bridge tab
       2. Select "WBTB to BTB" direction
       3. Use the "Send ETH Out" button to transfer ETH from your old wallet
     - Make sure to transfer all ETH assets before discontinuing use of your old wallet
4. Securely store your new seed phrase
5. Set up your unlock password

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Do not delete your old wallet until you have successfully transferred all assets to your new v1.0.0 wallet. Double-check both ETH and BTB balances to ensure all assets have been moved successfully.

## Important Reminders

- **ALWAYS** backup your seed phrase in a secure location
- Your seed phrase is the ONLY way to recover your assets if you lose access to your wallet
- Keep your unlock password secure but remember it can be reset using your seed phrase
- Never share your seed phrase or unlock password with anyone
